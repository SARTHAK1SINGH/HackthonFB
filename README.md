# Cure-Mate 🏥

### Sentiment analysis of user reviews for particular disease and medicine Using Wit.Ai <br><br>
We are trying to give the user fair information about what others think about that medicine he is using and what other <br> best-rated medicines suggested for this particular disease and User can also compare two Medicines to know the best one.<br>
We are using the UCI drug review dataset for getting reviews having more than 2 million reviews.

<hr><hr>

# Aim 🎯 <br>
Our aim is to give a platform that will be useful for both medical professionals and other Users. On this platform, they can study their situation and medicines, they can easily see the reviews for the work of medicine in that condition, and by our monitoring tool, they can get the latest information about the disease and its medicine. It would be really helpful in these pandemic situations like Covid-19 created. These situations create shortages of medicines. So, through our platform medical professionals and users can easily check alternate best medicine for the same situation and much other information that they need.

# Details of NLP Model 📚 <br>

### ▶️ About Model <br>
Sentiment Analysis is used on the pre-saved dataset (over 2 million) and the fixed data that is being Scraped from Twitter and Drug.com. Then data is broken into tokens and Using this dataset we train our model over **Wit.ai**, Wit.ai Speech API is also used to make our application voice interactive.  <br>
### ▶️ Model's Accuracy <br>
On running our Model on a pre-stored dataset we get the accuracy of about 85% and when the twitter and drug.com dataset is added accuracy increases to 87.05 %.<br>
### ▶️ Future Updated <br>
This project has a very wide area to which we can explore and we can add many new features in it. For the future, We are thinking of adding a feature to suggest the best Doctors and Best hospitals for the searched medicine. and it can be according to the city of the user and also best in his country By getting user location and Analyzing data from different platforms about the best doctors and hospitals for that disease. <hr><hr>
